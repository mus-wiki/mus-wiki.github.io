* TODO General Microbiology
** 1.Introduction - History and Subject
*** History
+ Microbiology is the study of living organisms of microscopic size
  + The term was introduced by the French chemist *Louis Pasteur*, considered to be the 'Father of Microbiology'
+ For many years it was believed that the microorganisms arose from decomposed organic matter.
  + This was known as /theory of spontaneous generation/
+ Louis Pasteur generated strong evidence to show that the microorganisms did not arise /de novo/ in the media but were introduced from without
+ Showed that microorganisms were inactivated by boiling at 120C(autoclaved) and 170C
+ Pasteur demonstrations prompted *Joseph Lister's* work on wound sepsis
  + He introduced the practice of protecting wounds from airborne microbes by applying antiseptic dressing and making medical workers wash their hands with antiseptic solution before they touch a patient, achieving striking success at reducing mortality due to sepsis
+ Pasteur developed vaccines against chicken cholera and anthrax by using attenuated suspension of bacteria

*** Subject
+ Medical microbiology is the biological study of bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa and large algae which are collectively called as microorganisms
  + Characteristics of Microscopic organisms :
    + *M* = Microscopic
    + *I* = Independent units
    + *C* = Complex -> less than plants and animals
    + *R* = Rapid growth rates
    + *O* = Omnipresent (present everywhere)
+ Medical microbiology is concerned with aetiology, pathogenesis, laboratory diagnosis and treatment of infections, as well as with epidemiology and control of infection in a community
+ Branches of microbiology include :
  + Bacteriology : study of bacteria
  + Mycology : study of fungi, includes both microscopic forms(molds and yeasts) and larger forms(mushrooms)
  + Parasitology : Study of parasites
  + Virology : Study of viruses
  + Immunology : Study of body defenses that protect against infection
  + Microbial taxonomy : Study of classification, naming and identification of organisms
  + Biotechnology : Use of systems or process of organisms to arrive at a desired product
  + Genetic engineering : Involves techniques that deliberately alter genetic make-up of organisms to introduce new compounds/genetic combinations


** 2.Bacterial Taxonomy - Classification, Nomenclatures, Identification
*** Classification
+ Categorization of organisms into taxonomic groups
+ Requires experimental and observational techniques
  + Biochemical, physiologic, genetic and morphologic properties are necessary for a taxon description
*** Nomenclature
+ Naming of the organism by international rules, according to it's characteristics
  + First word(Genus) is always capitalized
  + Second word(Species) is not capitalized
    /e.g Escherichia Coli/
*** Identification
+ Practical use of classification scheme to:
  + Isolated and distinguish desirable organism
  + Verify the authenticity or special properties of a culture
  + *Isolated and identify causative agent of disease*

**** Taxonomic ranks
+ Form the basis for the organization of bacteria, Linnaean taxonomy uses formal taxonomic tanks.
| Formal Rank | Example                 |
|-------------+-------------------------|
| Kingdom     | Protista/Prokaryotes    |
| Division    | Gracilicutes            |
| Class       | Scotobacteria           |
| Order       | Eubacteriaceae          |
| Family      | Enterobacteriaceae      |
| Genus       | Escherichia             |
| Species     | Coli                    |
| Subtype     | Escherichia coli O157:7 |
|-------------+-------------------------|

+ /Traditionally, all living objects had been divided into plant and animal kingdom/
+ There are some organisms that do not fulfill criteria for either of the two kingdoms.
+ A new kingdom *Protista* was created to include these organisms. Protista has been divided into Viruses, Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes

** 3.Bacterial Morphology
*** Morphology and Shapes
+ Bacteria can have either of the three shapes
  + Cocci /e.g S.Aureus/
  + Bacilli(rods) /e.g Pseudomonas Aeruginosa/
    + Filaments :  long threads of bacilli which have not separated into single cells e.g Nocardia
    + Curved bacterial rods, e.g Vibrio cholerae
  + Spirillar/Spirochetes /e.g Borrelia/
+ When examined from outside, bacteria have :
  + *Surface adherents and appendages*
    + Capsule and Slime layer -> collectively called as glycocalyx
  + Cell wall
  + Cytoplasm
  + Nucleus
*** Cell wall / Gram stain
+ Chemically formed by N-acetyl glycosamine and N-acetyl muramic acid molecules alternating in chains, /which are cross linked by peptide chains/
+ Bacteria are classified as /gram positive/ or /gram negative/ depending on their cell wall characteristics
  + Violet stain is applied to bacteria, followed by a decolorizing agent and a red stain
  + Those who walls retain violet(blue) dye are Gram Positive
  + Those that appear red, not having retained the first dye are Gram-Negative

| *Gram Positive*                                            | *Gram Negative*                                                            |

|------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

+ Bacterial exceptions
  + Mycobacteria -> consist of mycolic acids
  + Chlamydia -> muramic acid
  + Mycoplasma -> No cell wall, incoporates sterols
** 6.Bacterial ultrastructure - external structures
+ *Capsules* - Glycocalyx
  + Some bacteria are closely surrounded by loose polysaccharide or protein layers called capsules
  + Functions of capsules:
    + Protein against phagocytosis
    + K-Antigen polysaccharides, protect from immune system
    + Promote adherance
+ Flagella
  + Aid motility
+ Pili
  + Adherence
  + Sex pili promotes conjugation -> plasmid transfer
** 7.Bacterial ultrastructure - spores
+ Bacterial endospores are the most resistant cells
+ Spore = dehydrated, multi-shelled structure, dormant
+ Formed when nutrients are limited
  + Allows bacteria to survive extreme conditions
  + Spores lack metabolic activity
  + Core contains dipicolinic acid -> responsible for heat resistance
+ Must autoclave to kill spores
+ Hydrogen peroxide and iodine based agents are also sporicidal

** 8.Bacterial Metabolism
+ Bacterial metabolism refers to biochemical reactions that occur within a bacterium
+ Bacterial can be further classified according to their metabolic process i.e how they deal with oxygen, how they deal with their carbon energy source as well as the end products they produce
+ Classification according to oxygen utilization
  + Obligate Aerobes
    + Cannot survive without oxygen
    + Require oxygen for growth
    + Use O2 as final e- acceptor in aerobic respiration
  + Obligate Anaerobes
    + Cannot survive in the presence of oxygen
    + Don't need O2 as nutrient
    + Survive by fermentation and anaerobic respiration
  + Facultative anaerobes
    + Prefer O2 but can grow without it
** 9.Bacterial growth and cell division
*** Bacterial growth requirments
+ Effects of pH
  + Acidophiles -> prefer acidic environments e.g mycobacteria
  + Neutrophils -> neutral pH
  + Alkaliphile -> alkaline environments e.g Vibrio cholerae
+ Effects of Temperature
  + Psychrophile -> prefer cold
  + Mesophile -> prefer 37C
  + Thermophile -> prefer hot > 45C
*** Bacterial Cell division
+ Grow and replicate by binary fission
+ Asexual type of cell division
  + two identical daughter cells are formed
** 10.Bacterial Genetics: DNA- the genetic material-structure, replication and function
+ Genetics is the science of hereditary and variability of organisms, including microorganisms
*** Genetic material-structure
+ Bacterial genome consists of :
  + Bacterial chromosome
  + Plasmids
  + Transpons
  + Integrons
+ *Bacterial chromosome*
  + A single circular haploid circular molecule
  + Bacterial DNA is *super-coiled* due to DNA gyrase
+ *Plasmids*
  + Extrachromosomal, non-essential, replicate independently of bacterial chromosome, smaller than chromosome
  + Carry genes for virulence factors or antibiotic resistance
+ *Transpons*
  + /known as jumping genes/
  + Transfer genes from one place to another or between different DNA molecules i.e plasmid -> chromosome
+ *Integrons*
  + Contains cassettes of resistance genes and together with transpons play important role in dissemination of antimicrobial resistance
*** Replication
+ Replication is initiated at Ori C
+ Helicase unwinds double helix -> replication fork
+ Primase synethesizes Primer
+ DNA polymerase synthesizes a copy of DNA in 5-3 direction, leading and lagging strands
+ DNA ligase 'glues' pieces of DNA on lagging strand
*** Function
+ Bacteria don't have any introns or exons
+ Genes are organized into operons
+ Operon = Genes that are *controlled by operator*
+ /e.g Lac Operon in E.Coli/
** 11.Bacterial Genetics : Mutation, recombination and DNA exchange
+ *Transformation*:
  + Competent bacteria can bind and import pieces of environmental naked bacterial DNA
+ *Conjugation*
  + Transfer of dna material using plasmids
+ *Transduction*
  + Generalized -> A *packaging* error. Lytic phage infects bacterium, leading to cleavage of bacterial DNA. Parts of bacterial chromosomal DNA may become packaged in phage capsid, phage infects another bacterium, transferring these genes
  + Speciliazed -> An *excision* event.
    + Lysogenic phage infects bacterium
    + Viral DNA incoporates into bacterial chromosome
    + When phage DNA is excised, bacterial genes may be excised with it
    + DNA is packaged into phage capsid and can infect another bacterium

** 31. Laboratory Diagnosis of Bacterial Diseases
*** Specimens
+ A properly collected specimen is the single most important step in the diagnosis of an infection
+ The specimen must be obtained from the site most likely to yield the agent at that particular stage of illness and must be handled in such a way as to favor the agent's survival and growth
+ *A few general rules apply to all specimens:*
  1. Quantity of the material must be adequate
  2. Sample should be representative of the infectious process /e.g sputum, not saliva/
  3. Contamination of the specimen must be avoided by using *only sterile equipment and aseptic precautions.*
  4. Specimen must be taken to the laboratory and examined promptly, special transport media me be helpful
  5. Meaningful specimens to diagnose bacterial infections must be secured before antimicrobial drugs are administered
*** Microscopy and stains
+ Microscopic examination of stained or unstained specimens is relatively simple and inexpensive, but much less sensitive method
+ *Gram staining* is very useful procedure in diagnostic microbiology, /e.g gram positive cocci in clusters indicates staph infections/
+ *Acid-fast(Ziehl-Neelsen)* stain used for /e.g diagnosis of mycobacteria in laboratories that lack IF staining/
+ *Immunofluorescent antibody (IF) staining*
  + Fluorescein-labeled antibodies in common use are made from anti-sera produced by injecting animals with whole organisms
  + Most useful in confirming the presence of specific organisms /such as Bordetella pertussis,Legionella pneumophila/
*** Culture systems:
+ Standard medium is *blood agar* /most aerobic and facultative anaerobic organisms will grow on blood agar/
+ *Chocolate agar*, is used to grow organisms that do not grow in blood agar such as /Haemophilus Influenza and Neisseria/
+ A selective medium for enteric gram negative rods such as /MacConkey agar/ is used routinely
+ Specialized media are commonly used in diagnostic bacteriology
  + the laboratory stuff selects the specific media on the basis of the information of the culture requires
  + /e.g freshly made Bordet-Gengou or charcoal containing medium is used for B.Pertussis/
*** Antigen detection
+ EIAs, including *ELISA* (/enzyme linked immunosorbent assays)/ and *agglutination tests* are used to detect antigens of infectious agents.
+ *EIAs format:*
  + One commonly used format is to bind a capture antibody, specific for the antigen in question, to the wells of plastic micro-dilution trays.
  + The specimen containing the antigen is incubated in the wells followed by washing of the wells.
  + A second antibody for the antigen, labeled with enzyme, is used to detect the antigen
  + Addition of the substrate for the enzyme allows detection of the bound antigen by colorimetric reaction
+ *Latent agglutination test format*
  + Directed ath the detection of the carbohydrate antigens of the encapsulated microorganisms
  + /Used for detection of group A streptococcal pharyngitis and cryptococcal meningitis in AIDS patients/
  + Not recommended for direct specimen testing due to low sensitivity
*** Western Blot
+ This method is based on electrophoretic separation of major proteins of the organism in two-dimensional agarose gel
+ Used as specific test for antibodies in HIV and Lyme disease
*** Molecular diagnostics
+ This method is based on the hybridization of a characterized nucleic acid probe to a specific nucleic acid sequence in a test specimen
+ followed by detection of the paired hybrid
+ /e.g single-stranded probe DNA(or RNA) is used to detect complementary RNA or denatured DNA in a test specimen/

** 32.Staphylococcus
*** Characteristic:
+ *Spherical cocci, grow in clusters*
+ absence of endospores
+ non-motile
+ facultative anaerobic
+ *Gram positive*
+ *Catalase positive*
+ Present on skin and mucous membranes
+ Staphyloccous Aureus is the only coagulase positive Staphylococci
*** S.Aureus
+ Characteristic yellow colonies on /blood agar/
