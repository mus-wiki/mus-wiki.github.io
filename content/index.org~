** Building a website with org
/I'm using this personal website to learn how to automate the process of building a website using org-mode./

Currently I'm using [[https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes][org-html-themes]] with modified css, styled using dracula theme palette, along with a build script inspired by the [[https://github.com/SystemCrafters/wiki-site][system crafters wiki]]. My goal is to improve this format, and use it to make a wiki page for my university, hosting our notes/documentation of our medical subjects, similarly to the way I do in the *Medicine* section, for this purpose I'll try to keep this format/styling as simple as possible.
