* 1. Origin and evolution of cells.
** Nature constructs cells
  + The primitive atmosphere was devoid of molecular oxygen
  + This allowed interaction of carbon,hydrogen and with other atoms, resulting in formation of organic molecules
  + As chemical reactions became more diverse a primordial "organic soup" was formed in the ocean
  + Molecules able to influence reactions in the environment and construct their own copies appeared, leading to the "RNA world"
    + RNA molecules catalyzed heir own replication
** RNA World
+ /only/ RNA can both replicate and catalyze reactions
  + In the RNA world, it was the only biopolymer, later on, living systems acquired first proteins and then DNA
  + Around RNA and proteins, lipid self-organized into bilayers, acquiring "membrane", making a "protocell".
  + At some point, one the early living systems started using DNA to store genetic information. /DNA is more stable/
** Last Universal Common Ancestor(LUCA)
+ All early organisms died out without leaving any descendants, except one, which gave rise to all extant organisms.
  + This organism is referred to as LUCA
+ The only way to study it is by comparing genomes of modern organisms which are as unrelated as possible
+ LUCA lived almost 4 billion years ago, was an anaerobic chemoautotroph. With regard to its structure, it was a prokaryote
** Prokaryotes vs Eukaryotes
+ Prokaryotes are simpler than eukaryotes(e.g absence of nucleus), and have evolved earlier. For a long time, life on Earth has been prokaryotic-only
+ In order to know basic life functions and the minimum equipment of life structures, you must study the prokaryotic cell. In many respects, it is *the cell*
+ Prokaryotes have all types of metabolism seen in eukaryotes, and more
| Prokaryotes                                        | Eukaryotes                                  |
|----------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------|
| Small                                              | Larger                                      |
| Spherical or rod shape                             | Endomembranes, compartmentation and cytosis |
| Surrounded by a lipid cell membrane                | Nucleus with linear chromosomes             |
| circular DNA inside nucleoid                       | Mitochondria                                |
| Cytoplasm full of ribosomes                        | Cytoskeleton                                |
| Plasmids that contain DNA molecules                | Flagella                                    |
| Polysaccharide cell wall                           | Mostly aerobic hetetrophs                   |
| Some have a polysaccharide capsule                 | Cells divide by mitosis                     |
| Capusle might have attachments e.g pili/appendages | Sexual processes                            |
| Flagella                                           | Mutlicellularity                            |
+ The ancestor of eukaryotes was an anaerobic, heterotrophic *archaeon*
  + Found in hydrothermal vents as hot as 300C, in the zone between Greenland and Norway
  + This vent field resembles the habitat of LUCA
  + Because of its "fantastic shape", the habitat has been called *Loki's Castle*
  + The group of archaeans discovered there are genetically close to eukaryotes, has been named *Asgard*
+ It developed a cytoskeleton as inner support and disposed of the outer support(cell wall)
+ The genome was surrounded by membranes, to be protected from the mechanical forces in the cytoplasm.
  + This allowed for *nucleus* formation and mitosis
+ Proto-eukaryotes fed on bacteria, engulfing and digesting them. One however, was not digested. It's progeny remained in the host cytoplasm as endosymbionts, became *mitochondria* and made the host *aerobic*
  + *Mitochondria have their own DNA and ribosomes*, which are of *prokaryotic* rather than eukaryotic type

* 2. Proteins. Protein domains. Protein families.
*** Protein functions
+ Structural
+ Movement
+ Catalysis
+ Recognition
+ Homeostasis
+  Traits of an organism are determined by the proteins it can produce
*** Protein structure
+ *Primary structure*
  + The sequence of the polypeptide chain
    + Number of amino acids
    + Order of amino acids(arrangement)
+ Primary structure is determined by the respective gene. Based on peptide bonds between amino acids.

+ Ultimately determines all other levels of protein structure plus the function of the protein

+ *Secondary Structure*
  + Localized conformation of the polypeptide chain based
    + Polypeptide backbone forms shapes entirely dependent on how to best store energy, by adapting the lowest energy conformation
    + These shapes inclue :
      + Alpha helix
        + e.g found in myoglobin
      + Beta-sheet
        + e.g found in immunoglobins
+ *Tertiary Structure*
  + Complete Folding pattern, specific to its protein as it gives its function
  + Factors that influence tertiary structure :
    + hydrophobic residues in the interior
    + hydrophilic residues on the exterior
    + Disulfide bonds help maintain structural integrity
      + if a protein is highly compact we would call it a globular protein
      + if its long and "spinldy" we would call it a fibrous protein
+ Quaternary Structure
  + The way mutliple polypeptide subunits come together to form a larger protein
    + e.g the way the 4 haemoglobin subunits come together

+ Primary : Sequence of residues
+ Secondary : Localized folding
+ Tertiary : Complete folding pattern
+ Quaternary : Interactions of subunits

*** Protein domains
  + Tertiary structure packs the alpha helices and/or beta sheets in globular units called **domains**
  + Some proteins have a single domain while others have two or more
  + Different domains have different structure and perform different functions
  + Popular folding patterns are called **protein motifs**
*** Protein Families
  + A group of evolutionarily-related proteins
  + Share a corresponding gene family, leading to significant sequence similarity
  + Similar three-dimensional structures
  + Can be groped into larger clades called protein super families
    + e.g Immunoglobulin superfamily - contain a sandwich-like structure of two B-sheets
* 3. Nucleic acids. DNA. RNA
*** Nucleic Acids
+  Long Linear chains of nucleotides linked by phosphodiester bonds, forming a backbone
+ Nucleic acids are macromolecules responsible for storage, transmission and retrieval of genetic information
+ Two types of nucleic acids ***DNA-Deoxyribonucleic*** acid and ***RNA-Ribonucleic*** acid
**** Structure
+ Polymers of nucleotides
+ Each nucleotide consists of
    + Nitrogenous base
    + Pentose
    + At least one phosphate group
    +  DNA has A,T,C,G and deoxyribose
    +  RNA has A,U,C,G and ribose
**** Formation
+ Nitrogenous base binds to the 1' atom of the pentose -+  forms nucleoside
+ Phosphate reacts with the 5' hydroxyl group of the pentose -+  forms nucleotide * such nucleotides are called monophosphates * one or more phosphates may join the first one, forming nucleoside diphosphate, triphosphate etc. *** Nucleic chain * Nucleic acids are composed of nucleic chains, same as proteins are composed of polypeptide chains
+ To form a polynucleotide the phosphate at the 5' atom of a pentose reacts with the 3' hydroxyl group of another pentose
  + creating a covalent bond
+ The alternating phosphates and pentoses form a backbone
  + Their arrangement determines the **primary structure** of the nucleic acid
**** Complementarity
+ Nitrogenous bases bind specifically by hydrogen bonds according to the complementary rule
  + A with T or U(2 bonds), C with G(3 bonds)
+ Complementary binding defines the secondary structure of nucleic acids

**** The double helix and base stacking
+ Nitrogenous bases are **hydrophobic**(minimize their contact with water)
+ When two complementary strands bind, their bases stack together like cards to **exclude water molecules**
  + This forces the backbones to bend spirally, **forming a double-stranded helix**

+  To visualize nucleic acids we use cytochemical stains, e.g propidium iodide
**** DNA - helix types and functions
+  There are three types of double helices: A,B and Z
+ **B DNA**
  + The main helix type of DNA
  + Right handed
  + 10 nucleotide per turn
  + 2 grooves, one minor and one major
+ **A DNA**
  + Dehydrated form of DNA
  + Similar to B DNA, but with **larger diameter**
+ **Z DNA**
  + Z DNA is named so because its **backbone forms a zig-zag**
  + Formed in small parts of DNA, mainly CGCGCG sequence
**** DNA sense
+ To identify DNA strands, they are scored as the 'sense' and 'antisense'
  + **Sense strand** - Positive : coding strand
  + **Antisense** - Negative : Template strand, complementary to both positive sense and the RNA transcript
  +  The term sense and anti-sense are relative only to particular RNA transcript, and not to the DNA strand as a whole
  +  There are viruses, such as Arenaviruses, that are ambisense
*** RNA structure
+  RNA molecules are linear molecules, much smaller than DNA
+ Single stranded
  + Often has double-stranded parts called stem-loops/hairpin loops
+ Secondary Structure is determined by **loops**
+ RNA undergoes 3D folding as in proteins, called tertiary structure
  + Both secondary and tertiary are based on primary structure
+ Some RNAs have catalytic activity, they are called **ribozymes**

*** RNA - types and functions
**** RNAs involved in transcription or replication
+ mRNA - Messenger RNA : Encodes amino acid sequence of a polypeptide
+ tRNA - Transfer RNA : Brings amino acids to ribosomes during translation
+ rRNA - Ribosomal RNA : Makes up the ribosomes, with ribosomal proteins

+ **mRNA**
  + no remarkable spacial structure
  + each mRNA is a copy of a gene encoding protein, and brings the "message" to ribosomes
  + The coding region of mRNA consists of nucleotide triplets called codons which are recognized by the tRNA anticodons
  + The first codon(AUG) is called the start codon, while the last codon is called the last stop codon
+ **rRNA**
  + Engaged in hairpin loops
  + Structural role - formation of ribosomal subunits
    + The largest rRNA is a ribozyme
+ **tRNA**
  + Small
  + 4 loops, 3 large and one small
  + **Secondary structure** resembles a leaf
  + **Tertiary structure** resembles L-like shape
  + tRNA function is to match amino acids according to mRNA instructions

* 4. Recognition and self-assembly of macromolecules. Cytoskeleton.
*** Self-assembly of macromolecules
+ Ability of macromolecules to recognize each other and specifically bind spontaneously, forming supermolecular structures
  + The recognition is based on spatial affinity, we can compare to a lock-key mechanism
    + Self-assembled complexes are held together by non-covalent bonds
+ Complementary recognition and bidning of nucleotides **allows replication and transcription**, the basis of life
+ Heating above 70C causes denaturation of DNA - seperation of the two strands
  + but this process is reversible, when the solution is cooled cown, DNA strands find their complementary partners and pair by hydrogen bonds
    + this process is called annealing
  + if the paired strands are derived from one and the **same molecule**, the annealing is called **renaturation or reassociation**.
  + if the pairned strands are derived from **different DNA molecules**, the annealing is called **hybridization**
  + RNAs also hybridize

*** Cytoskeleton
**** Types - Ranked by size
  + Microfilaments
    + Helix appearing as made up of 2 protofilaments
    + Consist of Actin(globular protein)
  + Intermediate filaments
    + Bundle of tetramers made of dimers
    + Fibrous proteins(keratins in epithelial, desmin in muscle)
  + Microtubules
    + Hollow tube of 13 protofilaments made of AB-tubulin dimers
+ The cytoskeleton includes all of those types. Intermediate filaments are characteristic of animals(not in plants)

**** Microtubules
+ Self-assemble from dimers composed of alpha and beta tubulin. Energy from GTP is used
+ Microtubules are hollow tubes *with a diameter of 25nm*
+ Microtubule is **composed of 13 protofilaments**
+ Eventhough some microtubules e.g in flagella are very stable, microtubules in cytoplasm have a property called dynamic instability
  + It means that their + end grows by addition of tubulin dimer but occasionally collapses
  + Dynamic instability is regulated, it is increased when the cell starts division

**** Microfilament composition, assembly and polarity
+ Microfilaments are assembled from actin using ATP energy. The single soluble actin molecules are called **globular (G-) actin** while those included in microfilaments are called **fibrillar (F-) actin**
+ Acting molecules are arranged in a double helix
  + The microfilament can be described as a single helix
+ Microfilaments **grow just one of their ends**, its called '+' while the other one is '-'

****# Myosins
+ Microfilaments responsible for transport of membrane organelles, as well as movement and shape changes
+ Motor proteins, called myosins use **ATP to move to the '+' end**
+ Has a **head** with ATPase activity and along fibrous **tail**
+  Myosin is unusual in that it is both a fibrous protein and an enzyme(ATPase)

**** Intermediate filaments
+ Size less than microtubules and bigger than microfilaments
+ **Fibrous proteins with the 'coiled coil' motif**
+ Provide mechanical support, **not fit for transport because they have NO POLARITY**
+ Common types :
  + Lamins
    + located in the nucleus, also called **Nuclear lamina**
  + keratins in epithelial
  + desmin in muscles
  + neurofilament proteins in neurons

* TODO 5. Transcription.
**** General characteristics
+ DNA function is to just store genetic information
  + genes are expressed only after their translation into RNA
+ *Transcription is a process of RNA synthesis using a particular DNA segment as a template*
  + The copied DNA segment has specific beginning and end sequences to define the first and last point ofthe transcription
  + Each DNA strand is a template for some genes and complementary(coding) for other genes
  + The template DNA and synthesized RNA are antiparallel and complementary(A-U, G-C)
  + The direction of RNA synthesis is 5'->3'

* TODO 7. Genetic code. Translation.

* TODO 8. Proteins after translation: sorting, folding, modifications, degradation.

* 9. DNA replication.
*** DNA Replication
+ Semiconservative
  + Takes 2 old strands, makes 2 new strands complementary to them
+ Occurs in a 5' -> 3' direction
  + 5' -> phosphate
  + 3' -> OH group
+ DNA replication is *bi-directional*
+ Has 3 phases, *Initiation, Elongation, Termination*
**** Initiation
+ Starts at *origin of replication(ori)*
  + Consists of AT-rich sequences(TATA box regions)
  + /A-T has 2 hydrogen bonds, easy to brake compared to C-G(3 bonds)/
  + Eukaryotes have multiple multiple oris, Prokaryotes have a single origin
+ *Replication fork*
  + Y spahed region where both leading and lagging strands are replicated from the DNA template
  + Replication occurs in both strands simultaneously(bidirectional but always on a 5'->3' direction)
+ Pre-replication protein complex binds at origin replication, seperating A-T
  + Creates "replication bubble"
  + *Helicase* is found in each replication fork(one in each end), extending seperation
    + Helicase consumes high amounts of energy
    + Helicase causes supercoils, making harder to unwind DNA strands as the process goes on
+ *Topoisomerase* cause supercoil relaxtion
  + *Topoisomerases I and II* are found in *Eukaryotic cells*
    + Cancer drugs target Topoisomerase I (e.g Irinotecan/Topotecan) and type II (e.g Etoposide/Tenoposide)
  + *Topoisomerases II and IV* are found in *Prokaryotic cells*
    + We target Topoisomerase II for bacterial infections using *Fluoroquinolones*
**** Elongation
+ *Primer Synthesis*
  + /Synthesized by RNA primase/
  + Provide a 3'-OH group to which DNA polymerases can attach a DNA nucleotide
+ *DNA synthesis*
  + Occurs continuously in the leading strand, discontinuously in the lagging strand(formed as Okazaki fragment)
  + Primer removal and DNA polymerase I replaces the RNA primer and proofreads it
  + DNA ligase joins the free ends of Okazaki fragments
**** Termination
+ Initiated by binding termination proteins to termination sequences, /usually when helicases meet/

+ *Cell cycle*
  + the sequence of stages through which a cell passes from one cell division to the next
+ *Mitosis (M)*
  + a type of cell division in which a daughter cell receives the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell
+ *Cytokinesis*
  + the division of cytoplasm
+ *Interphase*
  + the time interval between nuclear divisions when a cell increases in mass
  + roughly doubles the cytoplasmic components, and duplicates its chromosomes
*** Interphase
+ Cells spend most their lives in interphase. /Cells are not actively dividing in this phase/
+ Includes G1,S,S phases of cell cycle
  + *G1* -> Cell undergoes rapid growth, chromosomes unduplicated
  + *S*  -> Cell prepares for division by duplicating its chromosomes
  + *G2* -> Cell grows and completes preparation for division(Mitosis)
*** Mitosis
**** Prophase
+ Chromosomes become visible under microscope
+ Centrioles seperate and move to opposite poles, provide attachment for the spindle fibers
  + Spindle fibers serve as guide wires for the attachment and movement of the chromosomes during cell division
+ Nuclear membrane appears to fade, it is dissolving to allow seperation of chromosomes and cell organelles
**** Metaphase
+ Chromosomes composed of sister chromatids move toward the center of the cell. /This are is called equatorial plate/
+ Chromosomes appear as dark, thick filamentous structures that are attched to spindle fibers.
+ Chromatids can become interwined during metaphase
**** Anaphase
+ Centromere divide and sister chromatids, /now referred to as chromosomes/ move to opposite poles of the cell
+ If mitosis proceeds correctly, the same number and type of chromosomes will be found at each pole
**** Telophase
+ Chromosomes reach the opposite poles and begin to lengthen.
+ Spindle fibers dissolve and a nuclear membrane forms around each mass of chromatin
**** Cytokinesis
+ Division of cytoplasm
**** Mitosis in intracellular parasites
***** Endodyogeny
+ Formation of two daughter cells, surrounded by their own membrane, while still in mother cell
+ e.g Toxoplasma gondii
***** Endopolyogeny
+ Formation of many daughter cells, each surrounded by its own membrane while still in mother cell
*** Cell cycle control
+ For each checkpoint permission needs to be granted, mediated by hormones and growth factors
+ *G1 Checkpoint*
  + Is the cell sufficiently big?
  + Sufficient growth factors and nutrients?
+ *G2 Checkpoint*
  + Is DNA copied properly?
+ *M checkpoint*
  + Are chromosomes aligned prperly and attached to spindle?



* TODO 28. Growth factors, protooncogens, oncogenes, tumor suppressors. Oncogenic viruses
* TODO 29. Cell senescence. Cell death: apoptosis, necrosis.
*** Cell senescence
+ Cell sensescence -> Age related damage
  + "Debris" is not divided evenly between the new cells, instead it passes to one of the cells leavin the other cell clean
  + Cell population becomes a mosaic of cells with half ageless and the rest with ageing cells
**** Telomeres
+ Telomeres consist of non-coding double stranded repeats DNA sequences(TTAGGG)
+ In the leading strand synthesis continues until the end of the chromosome is reached; however, on the lagging strand there is no place for a primer to be made for the DNA gragment to be copied at the end of the chromosome

**** Hermaphrodites
+ Most plants and some worms that contain both male and female sexual organs | /simultaneous hermaphrodites/
+ Some fish such as clown-fish are born males and change into females(dominant one becomes female) |  /sequential hermaphrodites/
**** Temperature dependant sex determination
+ sex determination in some species of reptiles the sex is determined by the temperature at which the egg is incubated
*** Genotypic sex determination
+ Male heterogamety, /XY sex chromosomes/. The males produce spermatozoa that carry either X or Y
  + Occurs in mammals and some insects
+ Female heterogamety /ZW sex chromosomes/. Females produce oocytes that carry either Z or W
  + Occurs in birds, snakes and some fish
+ In some cases, sex is under control of cytoplasmic elements, /usually in arthropods and nematodes/
  + /This is used to manipulate reproduction of mosquitoes and other disease vectors/
    + /e.g Introducing Wolbachia into a mosquito(such as Aedes) population will reduce male mosquitoes/
**** Primary Sex Determination
+ *Determination of gonads*
  + In mammals it is strictly chromosomal
  + Determined by presence or absence of Y chromosome
  + Formation of ovaries and testes are both active, gene-directed processes
**** Secondary Sex Determination
+ *Bodily phenotypes outside of gonads*
  + male has penis, seminal vesicles and prostate gland
  + female has vagina, cervix, uterus and mammary glands
  + Secondary sex characteristics such as size, determined by hormones secreted by gonads
  + *In the absence of gonads, the female phenotype is generated*
**** Sex chromosomes
+ Sex chromosomes may be:
| *Homorphic*     | equal length with relatively small SDR(sex determination region) |
|-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *Heteromorphic* | Large SDR                                                        |
|-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *X and Y*       | males are heterogametic                                          |
|-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *W and Z*       | females are heterogametic                                        |
|-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------|
+ The X and Y genes of humans:
  + Y chromosome is much shorter and only contains few genes (78 genes)
  + X chromosome is much longer and contains many genes not present in Y chromosome (~2000 genes)
  + /As a result, most sex-linked conditions are usually X-linked/
+ *Structure of Y Chromosome*
  + *Pseudo-autosomal regions(PARS)* /share homology with X chromosome and synapse with it during meiosis/
  + *Male-specific Y* /area composed of euchromatic regions contain functional genes and heterochromatic regions lacking genes/
    + Contains the *sex determining region(SRY)* /which encodes for testis-determining factor/
+ *X chromosome dosage compensation*
  + Each mammalian somatic cell, whether male or female has *only one function X chromosome*

+ Innate/natural immunity is :
  + non-specific
  + Does NOT become more efficient after the first encounter
*** Barriers
+ Physical barrier; Skin
  + Mucous traps pathogens and does not allow them to adhere to epithelial cells
  + Mucosal surfaces also contain lysozyme which digests bacterial cell walls
+ Chemical barrier; Low pH in stomach, fatty acid secretions etc.
+ Biological barrier; Competition by other natural flora(e.g skin flora, lactobacilli in vaginal flora)
*** Internal defenses | Tissues
+ Two types *humoral* (macromolecule solutions) and *cellular* (based on direct action of cells)
**** Cellular defenses
+ Consist of leukocytes
  + *Phagocytes*
    + 2 cell types:
      | Neutrophils           | Macrophages               |
      |-----------------------+---------------------------|
      | small                 | larger                    |
      | segment nucleus       | non-segmented nucleus     |
      | *polymorphonuclear*   | *mononuclear*             |
      | Only in bloodstream   | *bloodstream and tissues* |
      | Short-lived(1-2 days) | long-lived                |
      |-----------------------+---------------------------|
      + *Mechanism of phagocytosis*
        + Phagocytes do not recognize specifically any molecule on the surface of an antigen, they *recognize its carbohydrate profile*
          + This is done by *pattern recognition receptors*
        + Phagocyte engulfs and fuses its lysosomes with the phagosome
        + Pathogen is killed by two mechanisms
          + oxygen-dependent; reactive oxygen intermediates
          + oxygen-independent; lysozyme,proteases etc.
        + Digestion by hydrolytic enzyme follows
+ *Extracellular killing*
  + Two cell types :
| *Eosinophils*                                          | *NK cells*                                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Kill parasites by degranulation                        | Detect virus-infected cells and some cancer cells                           |
| Contain granules(lysosomes)                            | Granules contain *perforin*:                                                |
| Deliver lysosomal content by *exocytosis*              | ->Released on the target cell by exocytosis                                 |
| ->This process is called *extracellular degranulation* | Also secrete protease, which deliver signal for *apoptosis*                 |
|                                                        | If target does not die via apoptosis, necrosis follows(using more perforin) |
**** Humoral defenses | Complement
+ Most important humoral defense is a set of plasma proteins called *complement system*,
  + Most important complement protein is C3
    + C3 is cleaved into C3a(smaller) and C3b(larger) by *C3 convertase*
    + C3b is stabilized by binding to microbial cell wall, facilitating phagocytosis via *opsonization*
      + Phagocytes have receptors for C3b
  + *Classical Pathway*
    + activated by antigen/antibody complexes.
    + Proteases C1r and C1s cleave C4 and C2 to generate the Classical pathway C3 convertase C4b2a.
  + *Alternative Complement Pathway*
    + Trigerred by polysaccharides in bacterial and fungal cells
    + an amplification loop, is triggered when the C3b protein directly binds a microbe, foreign material, or damaged tissue.
    + C3b also binds factor B (fB) to form C3bB. FB is cleaved by factor D (fD) to form Alternative pathway C3-convertase, C3bBb.
  + *Lectin pathway*
    + triggered by binding of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) to carbohydrates on the target membrane.
    + The MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs) then cleave C4 and C2 generating the C3-convertase C4b2a.
  + C3b opsonize targets for phagocytosis and B-Cell activation
**** TODO Inflammation
+ Inflammation is activation of local innate immunity, both cellular and humoral, usually due to injury
  + /Signs of inflammation : pain, heat, redness and swelling/
+ Mast cells and basophils are responsible for inflammatory reactions
  + both contain granules full of histamine
+

* 47. Structure of antibodies.
+ Antibodies/immunoglobulins are protective proteins produced by the immune system in response to the presence of a foreign substance, /called an antigen/
*** Antibodies | Structure
+ Antibodies are divided into five classes based on their structure and immune function
  + IgM, IgG, IgA, IgD and IgE
+ Each antibody consists of *two heavey chains and two light chains* (4 polypeptides), joined to form a "Y" shaped molecule
+ The amino acid sequence in the tips of "Y" varies greatly among different antibodies
  + This variable region, composed of 110-130 amino acids, give the antibody its *specificity for binding antigen*
  + The variable region includes the *ends of the light and heavy chains*
    + /Treating the antibody with a protease can cleave this region, producing a fragment that includes the variable ends of an antibody/
    + /This fragment is commonly used for research studies/
+ Immunoglobin chains are composed of *domains*
  + Light chain has 2 domains; 1 variable and 1 constant , found in the N-terminal position
  + Heavy chain has 4-5 domains; 1 variable, the rest are constant
  + Depending on the constant part, there are different isotypes
    + The lighht chain has 2 isotypes: *kappa and lambda*, similar and perform same functions
    + Heavy chain has 5 isotypes: γ,α,μ,δ and ε.
      + IgG -> γ -> Most abudant, found mainly in blood, protect against bacteria and viruses
      + IgA -> α -> Found in saliva, mucous and breast milk, protect against ingested and inhaled pathogens
      + IgM -> μ -> Found in blood and lymph system, First line of defence against infections
      + IgE -> ε -> Found in lungs and skin, cause must cells to release histamine, fight off alergic reactions
      + IgD -> δ -> Found in the surface of B cells, help B cells maturation and activation
    + IgM and IgE have 5 domain heavy chain, the rest have 4
+ The 3D immunoglobulin structure is based on *beta sheets*
* 48. Functions of antibodies.
+ Antibodies/immunoglobulins are protective proteins produced by the immune system in response to the presence of a foreign substance, /called an antigen/
*** How antibodies work
+ Antibodies are produced by B lymphocytes(B cells)
  + When an alien substance enters the body, the immune system is able to recognize it as foreign because molecules on the surface of the antigen differ from those in the body
+ When an antigen binds to the B-cell surface, it stimulates the B-cell to divide and mature into a group of identical cells
+ Mature B cells, called plasma cells, secrete millions of antibodies into the bloodstream and lymphatic system
*** Functions and Usage
**** Neutralization of toxins
+ Antibodies against toxins are called *antitoxins*
  + They bind their targets and prevent their toxic action by distorting their active sites
+ To obtain an animal antitoxin, an animal is immunized with toxoid; Toxin inactivated by formalin or heat, but still immunogenic
+ We use animal's serum to relieve patients suffering from toxin - *Passive immunization*
+ We use toxoid injections in certain vaccines(e.g Diphtheria, tetanus), as well as for anti-venom snake vaccines
**** Consequences of antigen binding
+ *antibodies have no toxic activity*
  + Antibodies can bind toxins/antigens but cannot destroy them because they are not enzymes
+ Antibodies act indirectly:
  + The constant part of the heavy chain, especially the Fc fragment, is recognized by complement components and phagocytes and mast cells
  + Antibodies are *adaptable molecules*, acting synergistically with complement pathway and phagocytes
+ *The main function of antibodies is to enhance the efficiency of innate immune defenses by conferring specificity*
  + *Opsonization* : Facilitate phagocytosis; phagocytes have Fc receptors for IgG;
  + IgM and IgG can also activate complement pathway, leading to opsonization
**** Functions of different immunoglobulin classes
+ *IgG*
  + Predominant in fully developed immune response
  + Most abundant, found mainly in blood, protect against bacteria and viruses
  + /The only immunoglobulin that crosses placenta to protect the fetus/
+ *IgA*
  + Found in saliva, mucous and breast milk, protect against ingested and inhaled pathogens
  + IgA binds to the surface of microorganisms  and prevents their adherence to mucosal epithelial cells
+ *IgM*
  + /Best activator of the classical complement pathway/
  + Predominant immunoglobulin class in *early immune response*
  + Confined to the bloodstream; Crucial against bacteria and viruses
+ *IgE*
  + Found in lungs and skin, cause must cells to release histamine, fight off alergic reactions
+ *IgD*
  + Found in the surface of B cells, help B cells maturation and activation

*** TODO Composition
+ *Neurocranium*
  + Portion of the skull that protects the brain and major sense organs.
  + /If we think the skull as a rectangular box, the neurocranium presents at the bottom, back and sides/
  + Subdivided into 4 groups k
  + Initially developed as cartilages, produced by the neural crest and mesoderm mesenchyme
*** Phylogeny
+ The first big step; *Hardening of the feeding apparatus*, jaws were invented; massive and able to carry teeth
  + The development of jaws is based on various mechanisms of shaping cartilage
+ Species with an active feeding mode also underwent an extensive enlargement of the nervous tissue
+ *Brain case* was developed to protect the brain and sensory organs, which lead to increased complexity of chondrocranium
+ *To create cartilages for the skull, nature needs mesoderm and neural crest*
  + Neural crest cells induce formations of various elements of the cranial skeleton
  + Mesoderm contributes to the development of the chondrocranium
  + Neural crest cells also contribute to the anterior part of the neurocranium, and partly to the otic vesicles and jaw

* TODO 63. Phylogeny and development of the postcranial skeleton
* 64. Phylogeny and development of the skin
*** Skin
+ /The outer covering of the body in all vertebrates/
+ Provides protections
  + Mechanical against solar radiation and against pathogens
  + Prevents *dehydration*
+ Site of synthesis and accumulations of substances such as lipids and vitamin D
+ Contains nerve endings that react to touch and can also absorb and excrete substances
+ *Has two main layers*
  + *Epidermis*
    + Outermost covering of the body
    + *Ectodermal origin*
  + *Dermis*
    + Lies beneath the dermis
    + Composed mostly of fibrous connective tissue, also contains adipose cells, macrophages and pigment cells
*** Phylogeny of the skin
**** Evolutionary innovations in Fishes
+ Epidermis in fishes is made of *living cells* /with relatively low keratin content/, covering dermal scales
+ Within the epidermis, unicellular mucous glands reside, their secretions make fish slippery and difficult to catch
  + In some fish species, those glands are modified into venom glands
**** Evolutionary innovations in Amphibians
+ When vertebrates invaded land, the epidermis evolved a cornified layer(*stratun corneum*), found first in amphibians
  + Protects from dehydration
+ Presence of *multicellular* mucous glands
  + Ectodermal origin, but are located in the dermis
  + Release of secretions keep it moist so to *enable gas exchange through the skin*
**** Evolutionary innovations in Amniotes
+ Stratum corneum is best developed in reptiles, forming a dense waterproof covering of their body
+ Reptilian *epidermis* is dry, *almost devoid of skin glands*, except for scent glands around the mouth
+ Squamate reptiles(lizards and snakes) are *characterized by overlapping horny scales.
  + In *mammals*, the hairs are homologous to horny scales, providing heat insulation
**** Evolutionary innovations in mammals
+ *General*
  + Mammalian skin has *stratified epidermis*, composed mostly of keratinocyes, /containing some melanocytes and Langerhans cells(antigen-presenting)/
  + Characteristic *hair* that provides heat insulation and camouflage
+ *Dermis*
  + two layers, an outer papillary layer underlying the *basal layer* of the epidermis, and a *reticular layer* beneath it
  + The dermis houses sensory receptors, blood vessels, smooth muscle fibers, hair follicules and skin glands
+ *Glands*
  + mammals have two main types of skin glands, *sebaceous* and *sweat*
  + *Sweat* :
    + Coiled, tubular shape
    + Merocrine(release liquid secretion) or apocrine(release cytoplasmic fragments)
*** Skin development
+ Multi-step process consisting of
  + Epidermal specification
  + Epidermal Commitment
  + Stratification & Terminal differentiation
  + Growth of epidermal appendages
**** Epidermal specification
+ Embryonic skin development begins after gastrulation
  + Gastrulation occurs in the third week after fertilization
  + Formation of three germ layers; ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm
  + Ectoderm gives gives rise to both the nervous system and skin epithelium
+ Neural and epidermal fates of ectodermal cells are based on the effects of *Wnt, fibroblast(FGF) and bone morphogenetic protein(BMP)* signalling following gastrulation
  + Wnt signalling restricts the ectodermic response to FGFs, /which are required for neural induction/
  + This lead to expresion of *BMP*, /which also inhibits neural fate and/ commits the cells to *differentiate into the epidermis*
  + resulting in a *single layer of multipotent epithelial cells*
**** Epidermal commitment
+ The single layer of multipotent epithelial cells /initially/ express keratins K8/K18
+ This is *replaced by K5/K14 expression* prior to stratification, /marking the beginning of epidermal commitment/
**** Stratification & Terminal differentiation
+ Multipotent epithelial cells in the surface of the ectoderm *become the embryonic epidermal basal layer of the stratifying epidermis*
  + which gives rise to all structures of the future epidermis
  + The formation of the embryonic basal layer is accompanied by the development of the basement membrane, produced by the basal layer cells
+ Basement membrane separates the epidermis from the dermis and provides epidermal basal cells with growth factors
+ A layer of tightly adhered cells called *periderm* transiently overlays the ectoderm during embryonic development
  + /The periderm protect the developing epidermis from amniotic fluid, and is shed once the epidermis has stratified/
+ As cells in the basal layer proliferate, they form an /intermediate layer/ of cells under the periderm, which mature into *spinous cells*
+ Both intermediate layer and spinous cells express K1, whose expression is induced by Notch signalling
+ *Notch signaling* directs spinous cells to continue to differentiate, and migrate towards the surface to form *granular layer* and *cornified layer*
**** Growth of epidermal appendages
+ Development of the epidermis includes the formation of the epidermal appendages such as hair follicles and sweat glands.
+ During development, cells of the basal epidermal layer form buds, which are primitive cells of organ development
+ naginate into the dermis ultimately forming the hair follicle appendages, apocrine, and eccrine glands.

* TODO 65. Phylogeny and development of the nervous system (brain and spinal cord)
*** Phylogeny of nervous system

*** Development of brain and spinal cord
**** Neural tube
+ Neuroectodermal tissues differentiate and thicken into *neural plate*
+ Neural plate *bends dorsally* /with the two ends joining at the neural plate boarders/, developing into *neural crest*
+ The closure of the neural tube disconnects the neural crest from the epidermis. Neural crest cells differentiate to form most of the peripheral nervous system.
+ Neural tube forms beneath the dorsal surface ectoderm(future epidermis)
+ Anterior end will develop into the brain, rest will develop into the spinal cord
**** Gray & White matter
+ /Gray matter consists primarily of neuronal cell bodies that contain nuclei, white matter mainly of myelinated axons/
+ Differentiation of grey and white matter goes together with neuronal maturation, /the axons emerging from the neuroblasts form layers of white matter/
+ *Spinal cord:*
  + An inner layer of ependymal cells surrounds the central spinal canal. They produce cerebrospinal liquid
  + Neuroblasts in the *mantle layer* will become the grey matter of the spinal cord
    + *Mantle zone* differentiates into *alar plate*, which consists of sensory neurons and *basal plat* which consists of motor neurons
+ *Spinal nerves:*
  + The two afferent columns of alar zone receive axons from dorsal root ganglia:
    + somatic afferent column: receives impulses from skin and deep receptors
